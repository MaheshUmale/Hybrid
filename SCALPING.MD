### **GROUP 1: Institutional Rejection (The Mean Reversion Gates)**

### **GLOBAL POSITION MANAGEMENT (The Sovereign Standard)**

* **Trailing SL:** As price moves in your favor, the "Highest Seen" or "Lowest Seen" price is recorded. The SL is moved to **Current Price +/- (1.5x ATR)**.
* **Profit Capture:** Once price reaches 1:1 Risk-to-Reward, the SL is automatically moved to the **Entry Point** to ensure a "risk-free" trade.
* **Exit Protocol:** Trades are exited immediately on a touch of the SL or TP. No "mental stops" are used.
