Why
The
Fashionably
Late
Scalp
Works:
●
Momentum
is
a
term
used
to
describe
a
growing
energy ,
building
to
carry
an
object
in
the
direction
of
that
momentum.
○
In
terms
of
trading,
at
the
lows
of
a
move,
the
“momentum”
is
completely
against
a
stock,
but
as
it
begins
its
ascent,
momentum
can
begin
to
build,
and
the
likelihood
of
a
stock
continuing
in
a
direction
(trend)
grows
as
the
momentum
grows.
●
The
Fashionably
Late
Scalp
takes
advantage
of
real
momentum
by
allowing
the
momentum
to
build
in
the
direction
of
the
trend,
then
capturing
the
momentum
at
a
pivotal
point
in
the
way
the
stock
is
trading.
○
W e
use
a
unique
type
of
divergence,
followed
by
convergence,
to
observe
the
shift
and
building
of
momentum,
and
then
capture
the
momentum
that
will
continue
in
the
stock
as
the
9
EMA
(a
short-term,
exponential
moving
average),
crosses
above
VW AP
(a
volume-weighted
moving
average).
●
In
the
Fashionably
Late
Scalp,
we
allow
the
momentum
to
build
for
us,
we
identify
a
key
moment
in
the
scalp,
and
we
act
to
take
full
advantage
of
the
beautiful
principle
of
momentum.
The
exact
rules
of
entry
(all
rules
the
exact
same
but
inverted
for
short
scalps):
When
an
upsloping
9
EMA
crosses
a
flat
to
downsloping
VW AP ,
we
enter
the
trade
long.
●
W e
enter
the
trade
as
soon
as
the
cross
occurs.
●
This
cross
is
our
visual
signal
for
the
trade
to
keep
going
in
our
direction.
The
exact
rules
of
stop
placement:
For
this
scalp,
we
use
a
measured
move
to
calculate
our
stop
and
our
target.
●
In
trading,
a
measured
move
is
a
technical
analysis
tool
used
to
identify
a
stock's
price
movement
following
a
significant
change
in
the
stock.
It
of fers
insight
into
the
potential
move.
T raders
often
use
measured
moves
to
set
profit-taking
targets
and
to
set
risk
levels
for
stops
because
it
can
be
used
as
a
guide
to
show
how
appropriate
the
pattern
is.
○
Identify
the
low
of
the
day
and
where
the
9
EMA
crosses
VW AP
○
Measure
this
initial
move
○
Use
the
measured
move
to
set
both
a
stop
and
target
for
this
scalp
●
Hard
stop
1/3
the
distance
from
Vwap
to
the
Low
of
the
day .
●
This
is
a
trade
where
the
momentum
should
be
on
our
side
and
keep
moving
quickly ,
so
our
stop
stays
tight,
relative
to
the
reward
we
are
seeing.
The
exact
rules
of
exit:
W e
exit
this
trade

a

measured

the
low
of
the

The
factors
that
increase
the
probability
of
this
scalp
working
as
expected
(or
better):
●
If
the
volume
bars
during
the
convergence
>
volume
bars
during
the
divergence
○
If
price
moves
away
from
vwap
on
less
volume
than
when
price
is
moving
back
towards
vwap
it
signals
participation
and
sustained
demand
in
the
form
of
a
buy
program
that
is
creating
a
great
environment
for
this
trade.
It
increases
the
probability
of
this
trade
working
as
the
buy
program
is
likely
going
to
be
sustained.
●
Speed
of
the
price
action
following
the
“turn”
of f
the
low
of
the
day
○
Speed
just
shows
us
the
commitment
of
the
buyers
after
the
turn
is
put
in.
If
the
buyers
are
sustaining,
we
can
expect
and
look
for
a
steady
convergence
back
to
vwap.
Steady
is
best
here,
steady
can
tell
us
the
real
momentum
is
on
our
side
and
likely
to
sustain
and
even
accelerate
later
in
the
scalp.
The
best
measure
of
speed
can
be
to
observe
how
the
price
action
is
holding
above
the
9
EMA
after
crossing
back
above
it
following
the
“turn”.
○
This
shows
us
the
commitment
of
the
buyers
and
the
sustainability
of
that
commitment.
The
factors
that
decrease
the
probability
of
this
scalp
working:
●
Choppy ,
slow
price
action
following
the
“turn”
○
“Choppy”
price
action
refers
to
a
trading
condition
where
prices
move
erratically .
Prices
frequently
reverse
direction,
and
while
they
may
appear
to
indicate
a
directional
move,
that
move
is
unlikely
to
sustain
a
clear
trend.
Choppy
price
action
is
often
referred
to
as
“Noise”
in
trading
because
the
price
action
is
exhibiting
volatility
but
not
making
substantial
gains
or
losses
over
a
specified
period.
●
T ime
spent
around
the
point
where
the
9
EMA
should
cross
VW AP
○
A
significant
pause
before
our
entry
trigger
can
show
a
lack
of
commitment
from
the
buyers
and
can
lower
the
probability
of
this
scalp
moving
in
our
favor
quickly
and
cleanly .
When
do
we
avoid
this
scalp
entirely:
●
W e
will
never
make
this
scalp
when
price
action
goes
“flat”
and
choppy .
○
If
the
9
EMA
has
gone
flat
(completely
horizontal)
for
a
period
of
time
of
more
than
15
minutes
after
the
turn
but
before
our
entry ,
we
don’t
take
this
scalp,
It
may
be
a
dif ferent
scalp
entirely .
