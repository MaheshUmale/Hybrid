In
Play
stock
moves
away
from
VWAP
trying
to
move
lower ,
it
even
can
feel
like
this
might
just
keep
going
lower ,
extending
more
from
VWAP.
Traders
short
the
stock
already
feel
excited;
they
start
thinking
about
how
much
money
they
will
make
if
the
stock
does
extend
further!!!
But
then
it
just
doesn’t….
●
The
stock
stops
going
lower
and
buyers
step
in
to
support
the
stock.
And
then
buyers
continue
to
buy
the
stock
back
up
towards
VWAP.
They
do
so
in
an
identifiable
way
with:
●
distinct
higher
high
(at
least
1)
AND
●
distinct
higher
low
(at
least
1)
A
new
trend
is
established
with
these
patterns.
●
Following
this
new
trend,
the
shorts
who
were
initially
excited
about
the
potential
of
how
far
this
stock
could
go
in
their
favor
have
turned
hopeful
that
the
stock
will
turn
around
and
keep
going
lower
and
FEARFUL
that
if
it
doesn’t,
they
are
going
to
be
caught
on
the
WRONG
side
of
the
trade.
●
As
the
stock
continues
to
methodically
and
consistently
hold
higher
they
begin
to
lose
all
hope
and
the
FEAR
of
being
wrong
takes
over .
The
BACK$IDE
of
the
initial
move
is
being
established.
●
When
a
range
is
developed
above
a
short-term
moving
average
(the
9
EMA)
and
the
range
breaks
higher
shorts
stop
out
of
their
trade,
creating
a
fast
and
powerful
move
back
to
VWAP.
The
Exact
Rules
of
Entry
(all
rules
exactly
the
same,
just
inverted
for
short
scalps):
●
We
enter
aggressively
on
a
break
of
a
1-minute
bar
from
consolidation
after
the
“BACK$IDE”
has
been
established.
○
The
“Backside”
is
a
trading
term
often
used
to
describe
the
rising
phase
of
a
stock
price
after
a
distinct
low
has
been
reached.
During
this
rising
phase,
the
price
will
often
trade
above
a
rising
9
EMA.
This
phase
often
confuses
traders
who
don't
follow
the
current
momentum
in
the
stock.
○
Aggressively
means
paying
the
offer
for
a
long
as
soon
as
the
range
breaks,
don’t
wait
for
the
bar
to
close.
The
Exact
Rules
of
Stop
Placement:
●
Hard
Stop
trade
,
This
is
a
One
and
Done
trade,
ONE
ATTEMPT
ONL Y
○
Our
hard
stop
is
placed
.02
below
the
most
recent
higher
low
○
We
place
it
in
that
relatively
tight
spot
because
we
expect
the
scalp
to
quickly
move
in
our
direction,
to
drive
towards
VWAP
quickly ,
not
to
linger ,
fail
and
come
back
lower .
The
Exact
Rules
of
Exit:
●
Exit
entire
position
at
VWAP


Factors
that
Increase
the
probability
of
this
Scalp
working
as
expected
(or
better):
●
Consistency
of
the
price
action
off
the
low
of
the
day
○
“Consistency”
refers
to
price
action
that
has
clear,
identifiable
patterns
and
trends
without
too
much
erratic
movement.
Traders
prefer
consistent
price
action
because
it's
easier
to
interpret
and
make
trading
decisions
based
on
the
visible
patterns
that
show
up.
●
Time
below
the
short-term
moving
average
after
the
consistent
buying
begins
○
We
want
a
majority
of
the
trading
to
happen
ABOVE
the
9
EMA
confirming
the
consistent
buying
is
occurring.
●
Potentially
confusing
news
catalyst
for
the
stock,
because
that
can
cause
price
reversals
Factors
that
Decrease
the
probability
of
this
Scalp
working
as
expected:
●
The
general
market
trending
AGAINST
the
direction
of
this
scalp
○
It
is
less
likely
that
shorts
will
get
fearful
if
the
market
is
trending
lower
●
Location
of
range
○
Should
be
greater
than
halfway
between
the
low
of
the
day
and
VWAP
The
ideal
times
of
day
to
take
this
Scalp:
●
Ideal
periods
to
execute:
○
Morning
(10-10:45
am
EST)
○
Mid
–
Day
(10:46
–
1:30
am
EST)
When
do
we
avoid
this
scalp
entirely?:
●
We
will
never
take
this
trade
if
a
stock
is
in
a
day
1
break
out
on
a
higher
time
frame
○
We
won’t
buy
a
stock
that
has
just
gapped
below
a
significantly
higher
time
frame
range
because
higher
time
frame
buyers
may
be
wrong
and
need
to
sell
into
any
up
move.
