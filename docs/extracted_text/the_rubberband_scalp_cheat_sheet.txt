Why
the
RubberBand
Scalp
Works:
●
In
Play
stock
makes
an
extended
directional
move.
It
grinds
down
in
a
very
controlled
way.
○
Sort
of
feels
like
sellers
are
slowly
but
very
consistently
pressing
the
price
lower;
they
are
selling
but
not
rushing
●
Then
sellers
start
to
accelerate
their
selling,
they
are
more
urgent
to
get
their
position
sold
○
The
sell
program
starts
rushing
and
getting
sloppy
with
their
execution,
they
care
more
about
being
done
with
the
sell
order
than
they
do
about
getting
good
prices.
●
This
creates
an
unsustainable
amount
of
selling
pressure,
and
once
that
sloppy
sell
order
has
ended,
we
expect
the
stock,
the
rubber
band,
to
SNAPBACK
and
price
to
return
to
normalcy.
○
It's
not
the
extension
that
makes
this
trade
work,
it’s
the
sloppiness
of
the
acceleration
that
creates
the
opportunity
for
us
and
makes
this
trade
work
when
the
rubber
band
starts
to
SNAP
back.
●
We
wait
for
the
extension
to
try
and
stretch
as
far
as
it
can,
and
then
we
observe
for
a
moment
when
it
just
can't
extend
any
further
and
we
start
to
see
a
distinct
SNAPBACK,
a
clear
change
in
the
participants
involved
in
the
stock
and
we
take
advantage
of
the
aggressive
sell
program
ending
and
ride
the
SNAP
back
up.
●
This
works
the
exact
same
way,
but
in
reverse
for
short
trades.
The
exact
rules
of
Entry
(all
rules
the
exact
same,
just
inverted
for
short
scalps):
●
Aggressively
buy
when
a
SINGLE
green
candle
clears
the
highs
of
2
or
more
preceding
candles
(a
“double
bar
break”)
●
We
enter
as
soon
as
that
SNAPBACK
candle
takes
out
the
highs
of
the
prior
continuation
candles
○
Enter
aggressively ,
paying
the
offer,
without
waiting
for
the
candle
to
close.
●
This
is
a
2
Strikes
and
we
are
OUT
scalp.
○
We
can
give
this
scalp
2
entry
attempts
in
the
stock
in
a
day.
The
exact
rules
of
Stop
placement:
●
Hard
stop
.02
below
the
low
of
the
day
○
We
are
expecting
the
sell
program
to
be
done
○
Since
the
SNAPBACK
candle
almost
always
marks
the
low
of
the
day,
the
stop
is
usually
right
below
this
candle.
The
exact
rules
of
Exit:
Exit
in
1/3rds
to
let
the
rubber
band
extend
in
our
favor
●
Exit

position

●

Factors
that
Increase
the
odds
of
success:
●
RVOL
>
5
+
○
RVOL
(relative
volume)
tells
us
generally
how
In
Play
the
stock
is;
5+
RVOL
is
typically
a
very
In
Play
stock
●
Price
down
>
3
ATRs
from
the
open
○
This
is
a
really
solid
extension
typically
and
one
that
will
have
lots
of
participants
involved.
●

and
Range
of
1-minute
candles

the

lower
○
Showing
the
increase
in
acceleration
of
the
sloppy
sell
program
○
It
also
shows
an
increase
in
volatility
■
Volatility
=
opportunity
for
us
as
traders
●
SNAPBACK
bar
is
one
of
the
5
highest
volume
bars
on
the
day
○
This
can
confirm
the
strength
of
the
snapback
for
us,
showing
how
many
traders
are
aligned
with
the
scalp
we
are
making.
Factors
that
Decrease
the
odds
of
success:
●
Fresh
breaking
negative
news
in
this

against
the

●
Trade

The
ideal
times
of
day
to
take
this
Scalp:
●
The
best
times
of
day
for
this
scalp
are:
○
Morning
(10-10:45
am
EST)
after
an
accelerated
extension
from
the
open
○
Mid-Day(10:45-
1:30
am
EST)
after
a
morning
extension
accelerates
lower
●
Special
note
about
the
Open
(9:30
–
10
am
EST)
○
This
trade
can
show
up
on
the
open
IF
it’s
already
extended
on
a
higher
time
frame
(hourly
or
daily
chart)
and
then
accelerates
the
extension
during
the
opening
session.
When
do
we
avoid
this
scalp
entirely?:
●
If
the
stock
is
not
extended
from
VWAP
and
there
is
no
clear
acceleration
from
the
trend
●
Don’t
fade
a
cleanly
trending
market
○
When
the
Market
(SPY,
QQQ,
IWM)
is
down-trending
in
a
steady
way
(similar
to
the
consistent
trend
portion
of
this
trade),
we
want
to
avoid
this
trade
as
it's
simply
a
cleanly
trending
market
and
far
less
likely
to
give
us
the
Rubber
Band
effect
we
want
to
take
advantage
of
with
this
scalp.
