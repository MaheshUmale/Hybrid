Why
The
Second
Chance
Scalp
Works:
●
In
Play
stocks
that
put
in
ranges
can
offer
some
nice
range
break
trades,
but
when
a
range
initially
breaks,
it
can
oftentimes
“test”
traders
who
were
involved
in
the
range
break
trade.
○
It's
almost
a
game
of
hot
potato
where
you
have
to
be
super
skilled
at
reading
the
tape,
timing
the
break,
and
then
exiting
as
soon
as
the
tape
slows
to
really
enjoy
the
range
break
trade.
●
Another
trade
that
sets
up,
but
is
a
much
easier
trade
with
a
higher
probability
of
really
working,
and
is
an
easier
trade
to
take
is
a
2
nd
chance
scalp.
○
The
2
nd
chance
scalp
occurs
because
of
that
initial
rush
out
of
range,
but
then
on
the
pullback
to
the
breakout
point,
we
get
to
see
if
higher
time
frame
buyers
are
actually
there
and
will
continue
to
buy
the
stock.
○
We
get
to
see
if
prior
resistance
becomes
support,
giving
us
a
great
scalp,
or
if
the
move
was
just
a
rush
of
buying
and
will
result
in
a
failed
breakout,
trapping
those
who
are
stuck
holding
the
bag.
●
The
2
nd
chance
scalp
gives
us
a
way
to
be
a
sniper .
○
It
allows
us
to
sit
back
and
take
a
scalp
grounded
in
the
trading
principle
that
old
resistance
becomes
new
support.
The
exact
rules
of
entry
(all
rules
the
exact
same,
just
inverted
for
short
scalps):
●
Wait
for
a
break
○
Watch
for
price
to
break
through
an
area
of
resistance
with
a
strong
and
clear
move.
A
common
way
is
to
wait
for
the
candle
to
close
above
a
key
level.
●
Watch
for
a
Retest
○
Once
the
level
is
broken,
wait
for
the
price
to
come
back
and
“retest”
the
broken
level
allowing
us
to
see
if
old
resistance
becomes
new
support.
●
Attack
on
entry-
○
Allow
the
2
nd
chance
to
confirm
by
seeing
buyers
come
back
in
through
a
candle
that
closes
above
a
prior
candle
and
enter
our
position.
The
exact
rules
of
stop
placement:
●
.02
below
the
low
of
the
turn
candle
○
We
place
our
stop
here
because
this
low
should
line
up
with
our
old
resistance
that
is
now
new
support.
The
exact
rules
of
exit:
●
Half
and
Trail
:
Set
an
initial
profit
target
-
trail
the
remaining
using
a
short-term
moving
average
○
Sell
½
our
position
at
our
profit
target:
the
high
of
the
initial
pullback
that
set
up
the
2nd
Chance
Scalp


○
Trail
our
stop
for
the
remaining
½
of
the
position,
giving
it
room
to
run,
waiting
for
a
1-minute
bar
close
below
the
9
EMA
on
a
1-minute
chart.
The
Variables
that
increase
the
probability
of
the
Second
Chance
Scalp
working:
●
Significance
of
the
Level
being
broken
○
The
more
important
old
resistance
was,
the
more
important
the
new
support
becomes
●
There
is
a
visible
increase
in
volume
on
the
break
of
resistance
combined
with
a
low-volume
retest
of
the
prior
resistance
○
It's
a
very
visual
clue,
but
a
high-volume
break
shows
us
participation
and
a
low-volume
retest
shows
us
a
lack
of
urgency
from
the
sellers
above
that
resistance
area.
●
Trade
occurring
in
the
direction
of
the
market
○
When
looking
for
old
resistance
to
become
support,
it
can
work
even
better
when
you
have
the
market
trending
in
the
direction
of
our
2
nd
Chance
Scalp.
When
SPY,
QQQ,
IWM
are
moving
in
the
direction
of
our
trade.
The
Variables
that
can
decrease
the
probability
of
the
Second
Chance
Scalp
Working:
●
Over-extension
on
the
initial
break
○
If
the
size
of
the
initial
breakout
move
is
more
than
the
height
of
the
prior
range,
it
just
may
be
too
much
for
this
scalp.
●

The

Mid-Day(10:45-1:29

Afternoon
(1:30

When
do
we
avoid
the
Second
Chance
Scalp
entirely?
●
If
the
action
breaks
back
into
range
(back
below
resistance
that
should
have
become
support)
and
does
not
recover
in
the
next
candle
we
avoid
this
trade
entirely.
●
NEVER

this

2
strikes
and
we
are
