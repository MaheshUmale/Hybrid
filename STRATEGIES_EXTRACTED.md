# Strategy: Gap_Give_and_Go_Cheat_Sheet.pdf

 The Gap Give and Go Dynamics  : 
 ●  In Play stock with a Gap Up drops sharply from the open. 
 ○  This occurs as traders who were rewarded with the gap up in price quickly and aggressively take profits. 
 ○  The initial move lower should be quick, but should also hold ABOVE a level of potential support like a 
 Premarket low ,  higher time frame resistance turned support, etc. 
 ●  A short consolidation develops as the supply from the aggressive profit-taking meets the demand from the bigger 
 players looking to buy the stock. 
 ○  The consolidation can vary on the time and height, but here are some guidelines: 
 ■  Look for a minimum of a 3-minute consolidation and a maximum of a 7-minute consolidation 
 ■  The low of the “consolidation” should be above the key support level. 
 ●  Buyers step in with sustained demand, defending the support level and moving the stock price above the highs of the 
 mini-consolidation 
 ○  The buying does not have to be aggressive of f the lows, but it should be sustained 
 ○  We are observing that the early profit-taking gave way to sustained buying pressure. 
 ○  Real Big Players will buy through the open to get their initial position filled, giving us a move2move trade. 
 The exact rules of ENTR Y (all rules the exact same, just inverted for a short scalp: 
 ●  Aggressively buy on the break higher of the 1 min bar range. 
 ○  Aggressively means paying the of fer for a long as soon as the range breaks. 
 ○  Don’t wait for the bar to close, enter on the range breaking. 
 The exact rules of ST OP placement: 
 ●  Hard stop T rade - Potential of 2 attempts 
 ○  We place our stop .02 below the low of the consolidation that 
 was developed prior to the continuation break. 
 ●  If we are stopped, we can re-enter if the range is broken to the upside again within 3 minutes. 
 The exact rules of EXIT : 
 This is a Move2Move trade, we look for 2 moves before we exit. 
 ●  The first move is often quick and aggressive, putting us in the money fast. 
 ●  This gives way to a slight pullback that MUST hold the highs of the mini-consolidation 
 ○  (Ideally , it holds VW AP and the 9 EMA as well) 
 ●  Buyers step back in and continue to take price higher , with an increased urgency 
 from the buyers as the momentum builds. 
 ●  We exit the position on a double bar break against our position. 

 Factors that Increase the odds of success: 
 ●  Increase in volume on the break of the consolidation 
 ○  The stock is In-Play so the volume should be elevated already , but ideally we observe a visible decrease in 
 the volume during the consolidation. 
 ■  50% or less volume than the prior candles can be a good threshold 
 ●  Market trending in the direction of the trade you are making 
 ○  If SPY , QQQ, and IWM are trending higher , this trade can be extra good. 
 ■  If the sector is trending similarly , it can help our trade as there is large buying across the sector . 
 Factors that Decrease the odds of success: 
 ●  Over-extension of the initial move from the open. 
 ○  If the move lower from the open closes more than 50% of the gap prior to the mini-consolidation starting, we 
 are very careful with this trade. 
 ●  Multiple attempts higher prior to the consolidation starting. 
 ○  We don’t want to see the buyers stepping in multiple times and being met with more sellers each time; we 
 don't want to be trading against slow , sustained selling prior to the mini-consolidation starting. 
 ●  Fighting a bigger-picture trend on the day . 
 ○  Like the factor that increases the probability , we don’t want to fight larger orders potentially against this 
 trade. 
 The ideal times of day: 
 ●  Opening drive trade (see it start from the open and trigger before 9:45 am EST) 
 When do we avoid the Gap Give and Go entirely? 
 ●  We will never make this trade when the mini-consolidation is below a key support level. 
 ●  We will never make this trade when the size of the mini-consolidation is more than 50% of the initial opening range 
 move that went lower from the gap open. 
 ○  This means the mini-consolidation is not really defined by a range, it’ s just moving sporadically all over the 
 place, like a plastic bag caught in the wind. 
 ○  We will never make this trade on a stock that is not In-Play

# Strategy: MACD-Cheat-Sheet.pdf

 The Dynamics of the Base Hit Scalp Trade: 
 ●  In Play stock putting in a range. It can be tricky to trade the ranges at times, especially when we are anxious, 
 are excited, are in an anticipatory mindset. 
 ○  The anticipatory mindset often manifests itself through one, or a series of invetned trades. 
 ■  Trades that on the surface seem to have decent ideas behind them, but are not grounded in 
 real edge from the perspective of 
 ●  A clearly deﬁned, appropriate stop 
 ●  A speciﬁc entry trigger with a reason for that entry 
 ●  A distinct exit strategy (reason2sell) that tells us when the “meat” of the move is done 
 ●  For this Base Hit Scalp, we ﬁrst dentify the range turning into a consolidation 
 ○  The price action compresses and the MACD goes relatively FLAT for a period of 3-15 minutes 
 ●  Second, we observe a break of the range, and an expansion of the Fast and Slow MacD lines. 
 ●  Third, we observe the price retracement that occurs and look for the FAST MACD to dip below the SLOW 
 MACD. 
 The exact rules of ENTRY (all rules the exact same, just inverted for a short scalp: 
 ●  When the FAST MACD moves back above the SLOW MACD, and BOTH are above the 0 line, we enter long 
 ○  We dont have to be super aggressive here, we can often use a mid-point entry (between bid and ask) 
 The exact rules of STOP placement: 
 ●  Hard stop Trade - One and Done Trade 
 ○  Stop is placed .02 below the retracement lows. 
 The exact rules of EXIT: 
 ●  This is a Scalp Trade. We use MACD as a guide. 
 ○  We stay in our position until the FAST MACD crosses back BELOW the Slow MACD 
 ○  When this happens, we exit our position entirely and move on. 
 Set Ups where we look for this Scalp Trade: 
 ●  Gap out of Range 
 ●  Volatility in Range 
 ●  Trending Day to the Upside 
 ●  Failed Break Down 
 ●  Gap Down into key support 
 ●  Day 2 following intraday reversal 
 ** All of this can be reversed for short trades, just ﬂip the charts!

# Strategy: Technical-Analysis-Range-Break-Trading-Cheat-Sheet.pdf

 Range Break Trading 
 Range break trading is a trading strategy  used by traders to identify and capitalize on price movements that break out of a 
 predefined trading range within a specific timeframe. Intraday, we use range break trading as a way to capitalize on periods of balance 
 in the price action for “In Play” stocks by trading the change in the price action that creates excessive moves out of that balance. The 
 concept hinges on the idea that financial instruments tend to move within certain price ranges or channels during a trading session, as 
 they “reset” and significant moves or trends can start when prices break out of these ranges. 
 Start by appropriately identifying a range: 
 Establish Highs and Lows 
 The first step is to identify the highest and lowest price points of an asset during a specific period, which will 
 serve as the range's boundaries. For intraday trading, this period could be the previous trading day, the first 
 few hours of the current trading day, or any period of price action bound by the highs and the lows of the 
 range which create Horizontal Support and Resistance Levels. 
 Horizontal Support and Resistance Levels 
 Once the high and low points are established, horizontal lines can be drawn on the price chart to 
 represent these levels, which act as the range's support (low) and resistance (high) levels - These 
 levels become increasingly important based on the number of “tests” or “touches” of the horizontal 
 support and resistance levels AND the response of price to those levels 
 Early in the range being established, we look for fast moves away from that level 
 During the middle of the range we look for slower moves away from those levels 
 Late in the range we look for fast moves to the levels and then methodical moves away from those levels. 
 Timeframes For Range Break Trading 
 shorter timeframes like 15-minute, 30-minute, or 1-hour charts are often used to identify trading ranges, as they 
 provide a granular view of price movements within the trading day. Ranges can form quickly in periods of elevated 
 volatility - as little as 10 minutes, but generally, we look for 20 minutes to 1 hour and 15 minutes for a good range to 
 be established. 
 Volume Analysis:  Analyzing trading volume can provide additional insights. For instance, a decrease in volume 
 during the formation of the range followed by a significant increase in volume at the breakout point can validate the 
 range break. 

 Once a range has been identified, traders look for signals that the price is breaking out of this range, which could 
 indicate the start of a new trend. These breakouts can occur in either direction - upwards (bullish) or downwards 
 (bearish). 
 Bullish Breakout:  Occurs when the price moves above the range's resistance level. Traders might enter a long position, anticipating 
 further upward movement. 
 Bearish Breakout:  Occurs when the price drops below the range's support level. Traders might take a short position, 
 expecting the price to continue falling. 
 Examples of Trades that can be taken from a range break: 
 Range break Trade: 
 Stop  is placed .02 below the support level for a bullish  range break to the upside 
 or .02 above the resistance level for a bearish range break to the downside 
 Entry  is on the initial break of the range, we should  observe a clear change in the price action as the range 
 breaks and following the range break showing new momentum in the stock. 
 Price target  :  We look for a standard 2:1 reward to  risk on range break trades 
 Second Chance Trades (break and retest trades): 
 Following the initial break of range, we look for a “retracement” to the breakout point of the range and we look for a 
 “TURN” candle. 
 Stop  is placed .2 below the low of the “Turn” candle 
 Entry  is on the first candle that closes in the direction of the range break following the “retest” of   the 
 breakout level. 
 Price Targets  : we take initial profit (½) our position  at the prior high and trail stop with position 
 Failed Break out of Range 
 Price attempts to break the range, and even breaks the range, but the price action does not support the 
 movement. Price trades back into the prior range creating a Failed Break Out. . 
 Stop  is placed .02 below the low of the failed break  down. 
 Entry  is on the first bar that closes away from  range that was broken. 
 Price Target  is the other end of the range.

# Strategy: The-Fashionably-Late-Scalp-Cheat-Sheet.pdf

Why The Fashionably Late Scalp Works:
● Momentum is a term used to describe a growing energy, building to carry an object in the direction of that momentum.
○ In terms of trading, at the lows of a move, the “momentum” is completely against a stock, but as it begins its
ascent, momentum can begin to build, and the likelihood of a stock continuing in a direction (trend) grows as
the momentum grows.
● The Fashionably Late Scalp takes advantage of real momentum by allowing the momentum to build in the direction of
the trend, then capturing the momentum at a pivotal point in the way the stock is trading.
○ We use a unique type of divergence, followed by convergence, to observe the shift and building of
momentum, and then capture the momentum that will continue in the stock as the 9 EMA (a short-term,
exponential moving average), crosses above VWAP (a volume-weighted moving average).
● In the Fashionably Late Scalp, we allow the momentum to build for us, we identify a key moment in the scalp,
and we act to take full advantage of the beautiful principle of momentum.
The exact rules of entry (all rules the exact same but inverted for short scalps):
When an upsloping 9 EMA crosses a flat to downsloping VWAP, we enter the trade long.
● We enter the trade as soon as the cross occurs.
● This cross is our visual signal for the trade to keep going in our direction.
The exact rules of stop placement:
For this scalp, we use a measured move to calculate our stop and our target.
● In trading, a measured move is a technical analysis tool used to identify a stock's price movement following a
significant change in the stock. It offers insight into the potential move.
Traders often use measured moves to set profit-taking targets and to
set risk levels for stops because it can be used as a guide to show
how appropriate the pattern is.
○ Identify the low of the day and where the 9 EMA crosses VWAP
○ Measure this initial move
○ Use the measured move to set both a stop and target for this scalp
● Hard stop 1/3 the distance from Vwap to the Low of the day.
● This is a trade where the momentum should be on our side and keep moving
quickly, so our stop stays tight, relative to the reward we are seeing.
The exact rules of exit:
We exit this trade using a measured move
● Take the measured move from the low of the day to the spot of the “cross”.
○ Target 1 measured move above the cross.

The factors that increase the probability of this scalp working as expected (or better):
● If the volume bars during the convergence >volume bars during the divergence
○ If price moves away from vwap on less volume than when price is moving back towards vwap it signals
participation and sustained demand in the form of a buy program that is creating a great environment for this
trade. It increases the probability of this trade working as the buy program is likely going to be sustained.
● Speed of the price action following the “turn” off the low of the day
○ Speed just shows us the commitment of the buyers after the turn is put in. If the buyers are sustaining, we
can expect and look for a steady convergence back to vwap. Steady is best here, steady can tell us the real
momentum is on our side and likely to sustain and even accelerate later in the scalp. The best measure of
speed can be to observe how the price action is holding above the 9 EMA after crossing back above it
following the “turn”.
○ This shows us the commitment of the buyers and the sustainability of that commitment.
The factors that decrease the probability of this scalp working:
● Choppy, slow price action following the “turn”
○ “Choppy” price action refers to a trading condition where prices move erratically. Prices frequently reverse
direction, and while they may appear to indicate a directional move, that move is unlikely to sustain a clear
trend. Choppy price action is often referred to as “Noise” in trading because the price action is exhibiting
volatility but not making substantial gains or losses over a specified period.
● Time spent around the point where the 9 EMA should cross VWAP
○ A significant pause before our entry trigger can show a lack of commitment from the buyers and can lower
the probability of this scalp moving in our favor quickly and cleanly.
When do we avoid this scalp entirely:
● We will never make this scalp when price action goes “flat” and choppy.
○ If the 9 EMA has gone flat (completely horizontal) for a period of time of more than 15 minutes after the turn
but before our entry, we don’t take this scalp, It may be a different scalp entirely.
The ideal times of day to take the scalp:
● Morning (10:00 – 10:45 am EST)
● Mid-Day (10:46-1:30 am EST)
Scalp Statistics:
●60% win rate
●3 to 1 Reward to Risk ratio

# Strategy: The_Big_Dog_Consolidation_Cheat_Sheet.pdf

 The Big Dawg Dynamics  : 
 ●  In Play stock has a strong opening drive and begins to build out a “WEDGE”, “FLAG” or “PENNANT” Pattern. 
 ○  We also look for several other”Checks” in our favor: 
 ■  Significant fresh news catalyst in the stock 
 ■  “Wedge”, “Flag” or “Pennant” Pattern holding above prior day high** 
 ■  High R VOL (relative volume) in the stock (W AY above average volume on the day) 
 ■  More than 75% of the trading on the day is above the opening price 
 ●  We look for these checks in our favor as part of the identification of this trade because these checks highlight the 
 predictable patterns exhibited by big players involved in this stock. 
 The exact rules of ENTR Y (all rules the exact same, just inverted for a short trade): 
 ●  Aggressively buy on the break above the T op of the “WEDGE”, “Flag”  or” Pennant” 
 ○  Aggressively means paying the of fer for a long as soon as the break occurs 
 ○  Don’t wait for the bar to close, enter on the pattern breaking to the upside 
 The exact rules of ST OP placement: 
 ●  Hard stop T rade - ONE and DONE trade 
 ○  We place our stop .02 below the low of the BASE of the “W edge”, “Flag” or “Pennant” 
 The exact rules of EXIT : 
 This is a Move2Move trade, we look for 2 sustained moves before we exit 
 ○  The first move is often quick and aggressive, putting us in the money fast 
 ○  This gives way to a pullback that MUST hold 50% of the initial move from our ENTR Y to where the first 
 Wave starts to pull back (Ideally , it holds the upper ⅓ of the initial move) 
 ●  Buyers step back in and continue to take price higher 
 ○  If the first wave is fast, look for a grindy ,trending second wave 
 ○  If the first wave is grindy and trending, look for a fast momentum second wave 
 ●  We exit our entire position on a double bar break lower following a second wave 

 Factors that Increase the odds of success: 
 ●  DECREASE in V olume during the formation of the “WEDGE”,”FLAG” or “PENNANT” 
 ○  The stock is In-Play so the volume should be elevated already , but ideally , we observe a visible decrease in 
 the size of the volume bars during the time the “WEDGE”, “FLAG” or “PENNANT” builds out 
 ■  50% or less volume than the prior average volume can be a good threshold 
 ●  Market trending in the direction of the trade you are making 
 ○  If SPY , QQQ or IWM are trending higher , this trade can be extra good 
 ■  If the sector is trending similarly , it can help our trade as there is large buying across the sector 
 Factors that Decrease the odds of success: 
 ●  “Crescendo” volume at the BEGINNING of the WEDGE or the PENNANT developing 
 ○  Crescendo is increasing volume on the up move with the T OP being the highest volume bar of the session 
 ●  Location of the “WEDGE”, “FLAG” or “PENNANT” 
 ○  If the “WEDGE”, “FLAG”  or “PENNANT” appears below the upper ⅓ of the day range or below VW AP 
 ●  Fighting a bigger-picture trend on the day . 
 ○  Like the factor that increases the probability , we don’t want to fight a down-trending market 
 The ideal times of day: 
 ●  Mid-Day trade (the break of the “WEDGE”, “FLAG” or “PENNANT” should trigger between 1 1 AM to 1:30 PM EST) 
 When do we avoid the BIG DA WG trade entirely? 
 ●  We will never make this trade when the top of the “WEDGE”, “FLAG” or “PENNANT” is below a key HIGHER TIME 
 FRAME resistance level 
 ●  We will never make this trade when the “WEDGE”, “FLAG” or “PENNANT” is more than 50% of the day’ s trading 
 range. 
 ○  This is a “sloppy” range” 
 ●  We will never make this trade on a stock that is not In-Play

# Strategy: hitchhiker_scalp_cheat_sheet.pdf

 Why the HitchHiker Scalp works  : 
 ●  In Play stock makes a distinct drive higher of f the open. 
 ○  This initial drive is not unusual, it happens all the time, but many times that drive higher of f the open gets 
 faded, and the stock pulls back while buyers and sellers battle it out for who is in control of the day . 
 ●  On this scalp, the stock does not pull back. It just holds up and starts moving sideways, building out a “consolidation”. 
 ○  The consolidation can vary on the time and height, but here are some guides: 
 ■  Look for a minimum of a 5-minute consolidation and a maximum of a 20-minute consolidation 
 ■  The low of the “consolidation” should be in the upper 1/3 of the day’ s trading range 
 ○  This price action is unusual. T o us, these orders are acting in a way 
 that is not price sensitive, they are not fighting for the best prices 
 they can get; They are large institutional orders that just want, 
 even NEED to get filled. 
 ○  Real institutional buy programs don’t tend to last for minutes, they tend to last for hours. 
 This scalp allows us to hitch a ride on a properly identified buy program 
 and allow it to do the work for us. 
 The exact rules of ENTR Y (all rules the exact same, just inverted for short scalps): 
 ●  Aggressively buy on the break higher of the 1 min bar range. W e call this the HitchHiker Candle 
 ○  Aggressively means paying the of fer for a long as soon as the range breaks. 
 ○  Don’t wait for the bar to close, enter on the range breaking. 
 The exact rules of ST OP placement: 
 ●  Hard stop trade. This is a one-and-done trade. 
 ○  We place our stop .02 below the low of the consolidation that 
 was developed prior to the continuation break. 
 The exact rules of EXIT : 
 We exit this trade using “waves.” 
 ●  Exit 1/2 our position into the first W AVE in the direction of our move 
 ○  It’s when the first rush slows after the initial break…. “W aves” describe the cyclical nature of the way stocks 
 move, particularly when specific buy programs are present. “W aves” create a sustained, initial move 
 following the break but go through a period of rest before continuing on. W e take advantage of this wave to 
 exit half our position and allow the stock to rest before looking for further continuation. 
 ●  Exit 1/2 our position into the second W AVE in the direction of our move 
 ○  This wave is more typically a grinding wave through the pullback and slowly builds with real acceleration 
 toward the end of the wave. 

 Factors that Increase the odds of success: 
 ●  Increase in volume on the break of the range 
 ○  The stock is In Play so the volume should be elevated already , but ideally , we observe a significant visual 
 increase of volume on the HitchHiker candle. 
 ■  30% or more volume than the prior candle can be a good threshold 
 ●  Market trending in the direction of the trade you are making 
 ○  If SPY , QQQ, and IWM are trending higher , this trade can be extra good. 
 ■  If the sector is trending similarly , it can help our trade as there is large buying across the sector . 
 ●  Consolidation occurring above key resistance level 
 ○  Examples of key resistance levels: 
 ■  Premarket high 
 ■  Prior day high 
 Factors that Decrease the odds of success: 
 ●  Over-extension of the initial move from the open. 
 ○  If it was just one big up candle, not a drive, we must be very careful as it may not be a real, sustainable 
 buying program, but instead may just have been one sloppy buy program. 
 ●  Multiple attempts higher (lower) prior to the consolidation starting. 
 ○  We don’t want to see the stock trying to break the range multiple times before the real range break, we want 
 to see the range trying to break to the downside and see buyers stepping in there. 
 ●  Fighting a bigger-picture trend on the day . 
 ○  Like the factor that increases the probability , we don’t want to fight larger orders potentially against this 
 scalp. 
 The ideal times of day: 
 ●  Opening drive trade (see it start to set up before 9:59 am EST) 
 When do we avoid this scalp entirely?: 
 ●  We will never make this scalp when the consolidation is just “choppy”. 
 ○  Choppy consolidation is when the stock is not really defined by a range, it’ s just moving sporadically all over 
 the place, like a plastic bag caught in the wind.  The price action is unpredictable and erratic, and most often 
 this can be observed if a stock is consolidating with large “wicks” in both directions of the bars showing price 
 is moving up and down quickly but lacking any real participation. 
 Scalp Statistics: 
 ●  55-60% win rate

# Strategy: the_rubberband_scalp_cheat_sheet.pdf

Why
the
RubberBand
Scalp
Works:
●
In
Play
stock
makes
an
extended
directional
move.
It
grinds
down
in
a
very
controlled
way.
○
Sort
of
feels
like
sellers
are
slowly
but
very
consistently
pressing
the
price
lower;
they
are
selling
but
not
rushing
●
Then
sellers
start
to
accelerate
their
selling,
they
are
more
urgent
to
get
their
position
sold
○
The
sell
program
starts
rushing
and
getting
sloppy
with
their
execution,
they
care
more
about
being
done
with
the
sell
order
than
they
do
about
getting
good
prices.
●
This
creates
an
unsustainable
amount
of
selling
pressure,
and
once
that
sloppy
sell
order
has
ended,
we
expect
the
stock,
the
rubber
band,
to
SNAPBACK
and
price
to
return
to
normalcy.
○
It's
not
the
extension
that
makes
this
trade
work,
it’s
the
sloppiness
of
the
acceleration
that
creates
the
opportunity
for
us
and
makes
this
trade
work
when
the
rubber
band
starts
to
SNAP
back.
●
We
wait
for
the
extension
to
try
and
stretch
as
far
as
it
can,
and
then
we
observe
for
a
moment
when
it
just
can't
extend
any
further
and
we
start
to
see
a
distinct
SNAPBACK,
a
clear
change
in
the
participants
involved
in
the
stock
and
we
take
advantage
of
the
aggressive
sell
program
ending
and
ride
the
SNAP
back
up.
●
This
works
the
exact
same
way,
but
in
reverse
for
short
trades.
The
exact
rules
of
Entry
(all
rules
the
exact
same,
just
inverted
for
short
scalps):
●
Aggressively
buy
when
a
SINGLE
green
candle
clears
the
highs
of
2
or
more
preceding
candles
(a
“double
bar
break”)
●
We
enter
as
soon
as
that
SNAPBACK
candle
takes
out
the
highs
of
the
prior
continuation
candles
○
Enter
aggressively ,
paying
the
offer,
without
waiting
for
the
candle
to
close.
●
This
is
a
2
Strikes
and
we
are
OUT
scalp.
○
We
can
give
this
scalp
2
entry
attempts
in
the
stock
in
a
day.
The
exact
rules
of
Stop
placement:
●
Hard
stop
.02
below
the
low
of
the
day
○
We
are
expecting
the
sell
program
to
be
done
○
Since
the
SNAPBACK
candle
almost
always
marks
the
low
of
the
day,
the
stop
is
usually
right
below
this
candle.
The
exact
rules
of
Exit:
Exit
in
1/3rds
to
let
the
rubber
band
extend
in
our
favor
●
Exit
1/3
of
position
at
1:1
R/R
from
entry
to
stop
●
Exit
1/3
of
position
at
2:1
R/R
from
entry
to
stop
●
Exit
final
1/3
of
position
into
VWAP

Factors
that
Increase
the
odds
of
success:
●
RVOL
>
5
+
○
RVOL
(relative
volume)
tells
us
generally
how
In
Play
the
stock
is;
5+
RVOL
is
typically
a
very
In
Play
stock
●
Price
down
>
3
ATRs
from
the
open
○
This
is
a
really
solid
extension
typically
and
one
that
will
have
lots
of
participants
involved.
●
Volume
and
Range
of
1-minute
candles
increase
on
the
last
“leg”
lower
○
Showing
the
increase
in
acceleration
of
the
sloppy
sell
program
○
It
also
shows
an
increase
in
volatility
■
Volatility
=
opportunity
for
us
as
traders
●
SNAPBACK
bar
is
one
of
the
5
highest
volume
bars
on
the
day
○
This
can
confirm
the
strength
of
the
snapback
for
us,
showing
how
many
traders
are
aligned
with
the
scalp
we
are
making.
Factors
that
Decrease
the
odds
of
success:
●
Fresh
breaking
negative
news
in
this
stock
against
the
trade
●
Trade
offered
on
Day
1
of
a
break
of
a
higher
time
frame
range
The
ideal
times
of
day
to
take
this
Scalp:
●
The
best
times
of
day
for
this
scalp
are:
○
Morning
(10-10:45
am
EST)
after
an
accelerated
extension
from
the
open
○
Mid-Day(10:45-
1:30
am
EST)
after
a
morning
extension
accelerates
lower
●
Special
note
about
the
Open
(9:30
–
10
am
EST)
○
This
trade
can
show
up
on
the
open
IF
it’s
already
extended
on
a
higher
time
frame
(hourly
or
daily
chart)
and
then
accelerates
the
extension
during
the
opening
session.
When
do
we
avoid
this
scalp
entirely?:
●
If
the
stock
is
not
extended
from
VWAP
and
there
is
no
clear
acceleration
from
the
trend
●
Don’t
fade
a
cleanly
trending
market
○
When
the
Market
(SPY,
QQQ,
IWM)
is
down-trending
in
a
steady
way
(similar
to
the
consistent
trend
portion
of
this
trade),
we
want
to
avoid
this
trade
as
it's
simply
a
cleanly
trending
market
and
far
less
likely
to
give
us
the
Rubber
Band
effect
we
want
to
take
advantage
of
with
this
scalp.

# Strategy: the_second_chance_scalp_cheat_sheet.pdf

Why
The
Second
Chance
Scalp
Works:
●
In
Play
stocks
that
put
in
ranges
can
offer
some
nice
range
break
trades,
but
when
a
range
initially
breaks,
it
can
oftentimes
“test”
traders
who
were
involved
in
the
range
break
trade.
○
It's
almost
a
game
of
hot
potato
where
you
have
to
be
super
skilled
at
reading
the
tape,
timing
the
break,
and
then
exiting
as
soon
as
the
tape
slows
to
really
enjoy
the
range
break
trade.
●
Another
trade
that
sets
up,
but
is
a
much
easier
trade
with
a
higher
probability
of
really
working,
and
is
an
easier
trade
to
take
is
a
2
nd
chance
scalp.
○
The
2
nd
chance
scalp
occurs
because
of
that
initial
rush
out
of
range,
but
then
on
the
pullback
to
the
breakout
point,
we
get
to
see
if
higher
time
frame
buyers
are
actually
there
and
will
continue
to
buy
the
stock.
○
We
get
to
see
if
prior
resistance
becomes
support,
giving
us
a
great
scalp,
or
if
the
move
was
just
a
rush
of
buying
and
will
result
in
a
failed
breakout,
trapping
those
who
are
stuck
holding
the
bag.
●
The
2
nd
chance
scalp
gives
us
a
way
to
be
a
sniper .
○
It
allows
us
to
sit
back
and
take
a
scalp
grounded
in
the
trading
principle
that
old
resistance
becomes
new
support.
The
exact
rules
of
entry
(all
rules
the
exact
same,
just
inverted
for
short
scalps):
●
Wait
for
a
break
○
Watch
for
price
to
break
through
an
area
of
resistance
with
a
strong
and
clear
move.
A
common
way
is
to
wait
for
the
candle
to
close
above
a
key
level.
●
Watch
for
a
Retest
○
Once
the
level
is
broken,
wait
for
the
price
to
come
back
and
“retest”
the
broken
level
allowing
us
to
see
if
old
resistance
becomes
new
support.
●
Attack
on
entry-
○
Allow
the
2
nd
chance
to
confirm
by
seeing
buyers
come
back
in
through
a
candle
that
closes
above
a
prior
candle
and
enter
our
position.
The
exact
rules
of
stop
placement:
●
.02
below
the
low
of
the
turn
candle
○
We
place
our
stop
here
because
this
low
should
line
up
with
our
old
resistance
that
is
now
new
support.
The
exact
rules
of
exit:
●
Half
and
Trail
:
Set
an
initial
profit
target
-
trail
the
remaining
using
a
short-term
moving
average
○
Sell
½
our
position
at
our
profit
target:
the
high
of
the
initial
pullback
that
set
up
the
2nd
Chance
Scalp

○
Trail
our
stop
for
the
remaining
½
of
the
position,
giving
it
room
to
run,
waiting
for
a
1-minute
bar
close
below
the
9
EMA
on
a
1-minute
chart.
The
Variables
that
increase
the
probability
of
the
Second
Chance
Scalp
working:
●
Significance
of
the
Level
being
broken
○
The
more
important
old
resistance
was,
the
more
important
the
new
support
becomes
●
There
is
a
visible
increase
in
volume
on
the
break
of
resistance
combined
with
a
low-volume
retest
of
the
prior
resistance
○
It's
a
very
visual
clue,
but
a
high-volume
break
shows
us
participation
and
a
low-volume
retest
shows
us
a
lack
of
urgency
from
the
sellers
above
that
resistance
area.
●
Trade
occurring
in
the
direction
of
the
market
○
When
looking
for
old
resistance
to
become
support,
it
can
work
even
better
when
you
have
the
market
trending
in
the
direction
of
our
2
nd
Chance
Scalp.
When
SPY,
QQQ,
IWM
are
moving
in
the
direction
of
our
trade.
The
Variables
that
can
decrease
the
probability
of
the
Second
Chance
Scalp
Working:
●
Over-extension
on
the
initial
break
○
If
the
size
of
the
initial
breakout
move
is
more
than
the
height
of
the
prior
range,
it
just
may
be
too
much
for
this
scalp.
●
This
scalp
fighting
a
bigger
picture
trend
on
the
day
The
ideal
times
of
day
to
take
the
Second
Chance
Scalp
●
Morning
(9:59-10:44
am
ET)
●
Mid-Day(10:45-1:29
am

●
Afternoon
(1:30

When
do
we
avoid
the
Second
Chance
Scalp
entirely?
●
If
the
action
breaks
back
into
range
(back
below
resistance
that
should
have
become
support)
and
does
not
recover
in
the
next
candle
we
avoid
this
trade
entirely.
●
NEVER
